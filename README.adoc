== Overview

When classpath for a Gradle `JavaExec` or `Test` task is long, Windows command executions give
error because of limitation to command line length greater than 32K.

With a number of classpath dependencies in a large project, typically JavaExec Gradle task
fails with error "The filename or extension is too long" and this would be a stopping error.
To solve this issue, use ClasspathJar plugin.

`ClasspathJar` plugin creates a classpath jar for jar files in the classpath
of every https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/process/JavaForkOptions.html[JavaForkOptions] task and sets the classpath with classpath jar.
This includes `JavaExec`, `Test` and other similar tasks.

== Installation

Follow the steps described at https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.virgo47.ClasspathJar[Gradle Plugin Portal page].
